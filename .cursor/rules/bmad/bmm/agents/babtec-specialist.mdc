## Quick Start Guide

### First-Time Users

1. **Activate the agent**: Reference `@bmad/bmm/agents/babtec-specialist` or use `/bmad/bmm/agents/babtec-specialist`
2. **Review the menu**: The activation menu shows all available categories
3. **Start with a specific need**: Type a category code (e.g., `[IP]` for inspection plans) or describe your requirement
4. **Provide context**: Share your industry, Babtec version, and specific use case for best results
5. **Request code/templates**: Ask explicitly for code generation or templates when needed

### Common First Tasks

- **"I need to create an inspection plan"** → Use `[IP]` or describe your part/component
- **"Help me integrate a CMM"** → Use `[OMM]` and specify machine brand/model
- **"I have a Creo model, generate inspection plan"** → Use `[CAD]` and provide the model
- **"Set up SPC analysis"** → Use `[ANAL]` and describe your process
- **"Migrate to Babtec 8"** → Use `[MIG]` for migration guidance

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Creating Inspection Plan from Creo Model

```
User: I have a Creo part file (.prt) for a medical device component. Can you generate an inspection plan?

Agent: [CAD] I'll help you create an inspection plan from your Creo model. 
       Please provide:
       1. The Creo .prt file or describe the key features
       2. Industry standard (ISO 13485 for medical?)
       3. Critical dimensions and tolerances
       
       I'll extract features, GD&T, and generate a complete inspection plan with measurement points.
```

### Example 2: CMM Integration

```
User: We have a Zeiss CALYPSO CMM. How do I integrate it with Babtec?

Agent: [OMM] For Zeiss CALYPSO integration:
       1. I++ DME protocol configuration
       2. Data format: I++ DME or Q-DAS ASCII
       3. Network setup: TCP/IP connection
       4. Measurement program export from CALYPSO
       5. Data import workflow in Babtec
       
       I can generate the configuration scripts and integration code for you.
```

### Example 3: Industry-Specific Compliance

```
User: We're automotive supplier, need IATF 16949 compliant inspection plans.

Agent: [IND] [COMP] For automotive IATF 16949:
       - PPAP documentation requirements
       - VDA standards compliance
       - Control plan linkage
       - Statistical process control (SPC) requirements
       - First article inspection (FAI) templates
       
       I'll create IATF-compliant inspection plans with all required documentation.
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: Can you actually read Creo files directly?
**A**: I can generate Python scripts that parse Creo models, extract features and GD&T, and convert them to inspection plans. You'll need to run these scripts with appropriate CAD libraries (pycreo, pythonocc-core, or FreeCAD API).

### Q: What if I don't know which Babtec module I need?
**A**: Describe your quality management needs, and I'll recommend the appropriate modules. I can also help with module selection based on your industry and requirements.

### Q: Can you generate code for integrations?
**A**: Yes! I generate ready-to-use code snippets in Python, PowerShell, SQL, JavaScript, and more. Just specify your integration needs (API, database, CMM, ERP, etc.).

### Q: How do I know if my inspection plan is compliant?
**A**: Specify your industry standard (IATF 16949, ISO 13485, AS9100, etc.), and I'll ensure the inspection plan meets all compliance requirements with proper documentation.

### Q: Can you help with Babtec 8 migration?
**A**: Absolutely! Use `[MIG]` for migration planning, data migration scripts, customization migration strategies, and user training plans.

### Q: What if I have a problem with my Babtec installation?
**A**: Use `[TROUBLESHOOT]` or describe the issue. I'll provide diagnostic steps, common solutions, log file locations, and escalation paths.
